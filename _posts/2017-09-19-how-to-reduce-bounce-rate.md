My experiment to improve my conversion from Google are now providing some results.

My experiments mostly dealt with paying attention to my headers, rethinking [my sidebar](https://thenextweb.com/apps/2012/05/15/useful-google-docs-introduces-new-sidebar-research-tool/), my ads strategy and a very special experiment with the small home button you see on the left top corner.Lets start up with a pic from my analytics.

The results of the experiments have been great. Let's look at some interesting facts about these experiments.

Every blogger has to embrace a cruel fact one day.You may rake in [thousand of visitors from referral sites](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2795830?hl=en). The ones from Google are the ones that count.

Why do we engage in social media ? Social media leverages our content. It helps us push content to newer audience. Most importantly social media leverage our content and provides ample force to fare better in Google search.

It could be safely argued that the whole ""SEO"" industry is based on traffic from search engines.With Google having the major foothold in search, it is ideal to create a strategy to make the most out of our Googlers.

So the question is how do you leverage your website to convert a visitor into a loyal reader ?

Less Cluttered Is More Channeled.
---------------------------------

There is not better way to learn usability but by observation. Usability stems from observation. I believe the biggest social network on the earth - ""Facebook"" stems from observation. A socially awkward person walks into a party alone and observes the interaction of humans. Using this information he creates a tool that aids this interaction.

So how do we really make a reader stick ? Well one way you can really engage someone is to provide them a piece of puzzle and providing them ample space to resolve. With me ? No ?

So the content you are writing should be placed at the top most level in visual hierarchy. If your ads, banners , videos and other elements on the page hinders your readers ability to read, you are out of luck.

So you can let go the ""[popups](https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/23/12610890/google-search-punish-pop-ups-interstitial-ads)"" and possibly delay the in page surveys by at least two minutes.

50% people clicked on the small icon on the homepage. Let me rephrase that. 50% clicks on that small button as compared to the other elements on the website. Can you imagine ? The total number of clicks on that small icon is more than the amount of clicks on my social bar combined. [The logo also raked in a lot of clicks](http://searchengineland.com/youtube-ranking-factors-getting-ranked-second-largest-search-engine-225533) after I changed it from a simple white text to more background header color.

Ushering Your Visitors - Don't Wait For Them To Bounce.
-------------------------------------------------------

I learned a very important lesson in primary school. When reading a book or a chapter from a book, the words that would remain with me were the last words in the text. After reading an entire book, the conclusion was the most critical and always stayed with me as the gist of the book.

Try this experiment. Send 10 of your friends a list of 3 simple questions. They could be anything. Basic question. Question they do not need to think about a lot. Make sure these are descriptive questions. The questions require atleast 2-3 lines of text from them as an answer.

You will observe that people are most likely going to answer the last questions in detail. Social patterns dictate that colcusions are the whole reason we wrote the content in the first place.

So in the last paragraphs make sure you usher your visitor to a useful link. Provide them direction on what to do next.There you go.My ideas and observation on what I have learned so far on making the most out of your Google Visitors.
